# Smite App  
**A lightweight site that provides analytical data from the popular multiplayer-online-battle-arena [SMITE](https://smitegame.com/.)**  
  
My goal is to provide a fast, mobile-friendly build recommendation experience. The site is built with Vue + Nuxt with Pico CSS.
  
The live demo can be found ~~here~~ TBA

Again this is a WIP and the recommended builds you see on the site right now come without warranty and make no guarantees about the statistical significance or validity of item combinations at this time. (I need more data, plz give access to dev API HiRez).

Sometime in January 2024 the applications for Smite's API closed, likely in anticipation for the announcement of Smite 2. I won't be able to launch the site until applications reopen.
